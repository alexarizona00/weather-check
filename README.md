Here is my weather checker!

you can access it by clicking https://alexarizona00.github.io/weather-check/

This is a simple web app that allows you to enter a city name and get the current weather, plus a simple 5 day forecast. 

I started with an openweathermap API account, mapping out the fetch request to get the geocode information and then a second fetch that pulls the current days weather as well as upcoming days. 

I wrote a for loop to iterate through the object returned from the API fetch and populated the card divs with the information. With a little testing, I got it working!

thanks for checking it out!
